Plaud
Should plaud be legal? During scrolling I saw an advertisement for an device for mobiles which could record and translate into text. My first thought: Should be this legal? Now a days you can't check whether someone is using this device or not. I think that this device is not ethical and could be used for purposes which would go against privacy.
Why is this concerning?
This device is available for public which makes it hard to moderate the intentions of the users.<br>
